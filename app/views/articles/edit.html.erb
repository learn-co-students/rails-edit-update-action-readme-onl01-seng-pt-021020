<!-- In this casee, form_for takes care of some work for us. Using the object @article we've provided, form_for determines that @article is not a new instance of the Article class. Because of this, form_for knows to automatically send to the update path.

Since @article is not a new instance of Article, the inputs on this form, the text field and text area, will be populated with the corresponding object values.

When submitted, the form will be routed to the update action. Before we try to implement the update action, let's first make sure the data is being routed properly. -->
